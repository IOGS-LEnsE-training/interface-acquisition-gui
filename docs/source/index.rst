Acquisition GUI's documentation
===============================

.. caution::
   This application and its documentation website are still works in progress

**Acquisition GUI** is a complete tutorial to develop a **graphical user interface** based on **PyQt6** in Python to collect data using an RS232 communication protocol from an acquisition home-made device.

In our case, the acquisition device is a *Nucleo L476RG* board from *STMicroelectronics*. The STM32 microcontroller is programmed using **Arm Keil Studio** (and MBED-OS library). 

The GitHub repository of this project : `Acquisition GUI <https://github.com/IOGS-LEnsE/acquisition-gui>`_

|

This set of tutorials is based on PyQt6 library for the graphical interface and on MBED-OS from Arm for the embedded device. 

You can learn how to develop graphical interface in PyQt6 with tutorials from LEnsE : `base_LEnsE_GUI <https://iogs-lense.github.io/base_LEnsE_GUI/>`_

A set of tutorials for MBED-OS and Nucleo boards are available on the LEnsE website : `Nucleo and MBED-OS Tutorials <http://lense.institutoptique.fr/prototyper-avec-nucleo-et-mbed-tutoriels-a-la-carte/>`_
